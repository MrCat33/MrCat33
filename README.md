### Hello, I'm MrCat 👋

---

Now,Focus listen from my voice

Three rings for the Eleven-kings under the sky  
三枚魔戒属于天空下的精灵王  

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone  
七枚魔戒属于石制大厅的矮人领主  

Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die  
九枚魔戒属于注定会死的凡人  

One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  
独一的魔戒属于高居黑暗王座的黑暗魔王  

In the Land of Mordor, where the shadows lie  
在魔多的大地上暗影幢幢  

One Ring to rule them all  
至尊戒驭众戒  

One Ring to find them  
至尊戒寻众戒

One Ring to bring them all
至尊戒引众戒

and in the darkness bind them
禁锢众戒黑暗中

In the Land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.
